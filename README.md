# Towers of Hanoi
The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle consisting of three towers and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any tower.
The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one tower in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top.
The objective is to move the entire stack to one of the other towers, obeying the following rules:
- Only one disk may be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the towers and placing it on top of another tower.
- No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

The minimal number of moves required to solve this puzzle is 2^n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.

With 8 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 255 moves.
